<h3>Distribution of earthquake magnitudes</h3>

<p>
  <b>Upper panel</b>: probability density distribution of earthquakes in the
  database (number of earthquakes per magnitude). Dark line represent
  the distribution of all the earthquakes in the database. Blue line
  is the distribution of a sample obtained after declustering the
  database.<br/>  
  
  <b>Middle panel</b>: cumulative distribution (number of earthquakes above a
  given magnitude).  The distribution obeys the Gutenberg-Richter (GR)
  law above a given "completeness magnitude".  Dashed lines are fits
  to the GR law whose b-parameters are indicated in the legend.<br/>

  <b>Lower paner</b>: ration of the cumulative distribution to the GR
  expected value.  This plot is intended to show the value of the
  "completeness magnitude", defined here as the minimum magnitude for
  which the number of detected earthquakes is above 90% of the
  expected according to GR law.
