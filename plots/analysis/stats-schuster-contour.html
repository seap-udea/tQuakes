<h3>Contours of Schuster's p-value</h3>

<p>
  This plots represent the value of the Schuster's p-value for a set
  of earthquakes with magnitude (M<sub>l</sub>) and depth lower than
  or equal to a given value.  Thus, the point M<sub>l</sub>=4.0 and
  depth 50 km in the plot correspond to the p-value calculated for all
  earthquakes with magnitude below or equal to 4.0 and depths lower or
  equal to 50 km.
