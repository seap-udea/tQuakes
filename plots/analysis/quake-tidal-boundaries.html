<h3>Tide signal with maxima and minima</h3>

<p>
  This plot shows essentially the same as the tidal signal figure.
  The difference is that here you will find the minima and maxima of
  the signal at different frequencies: semidiurnal (red circles),
  diurnal (blue squares), fornightly (green triangles) and monthly
  (cyan squares).  Shaded region represent the period of time for each
  frequency with respect to which the phase is calculated: semidiurnal
  (pink), diurnal (gray), fornightly (green), monthly (dashed cyan
  pattern).
