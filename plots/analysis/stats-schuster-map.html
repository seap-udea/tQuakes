<h3>Geographic distribution of Schuster's p-value </h3>

<p>
  The map shows the results of applying the Schuster's statistical
  test to subsamples choosen according to their location. The entire
  plotting region is divided in a given number of cells.  Earthquakes
  inside each cell are analysed using the Schuster's test.  The
  negative of the logarithm of the p-value is represented by the size
  of the circle in the center of each cell.
